# Human Speech Perception in Noise: Can Large Language Models Paraphrase to Improve It?
### Anupama Chingacham, Miaoran Zhang, Vera Demberg, Dietrich Klakow

This repository consists of code and data (including human evaluation) created for our HuCLLM@ACL 2024 paper. 

The work evaluates an LLM (like ChatGPT) on its ability to paraphrase a sentence, such that the generated paraphrase is acoustically more intelligible than the given input sentence, for human listeners in a noisy environment (eg., bable noise at SNR -5 dB).
Figure below depicts an overview of the two prompting approaches that we explored here.

Paraphrase to improve Speech Perception in Noise (PI-SPiN) is a text generation task, involving both textual attributes like semantic equivalence and non-textual attriutes like acoustic intelligibility. Prior studies used the following pipeline to identify acoustically intelligible paraphrase.
